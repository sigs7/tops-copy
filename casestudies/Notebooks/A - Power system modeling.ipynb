    "When the aim is on analyze electro-mechanical and control dynamics in power systems, it is common to represent the ac variables (such as voltage and current) as phasors. This method is often reffered to RMS-models or average models. RMS-models holds an advantage over their counterpart electromagnetic transient (EMT) models in being more computational efficient whilst still maintaining sufficient accuracy. EMT models are used when analyzing much faster dynamics at smaller timescale. The two images below shows the difference between EMT and RMS-models on how a short-circuit response might look like.\n",
